# OSMConstruct Luanti Mod

This project is a mod that imports data from OpenStreetMap (OSM) and builds it within Luanti. It automates the process of creating structures based on real-world geographical data. 

# How to use
1. Once the mod is installed, create a world with singlenode.
2. Download the data from openstreetmap. Place the '.osm' file into the world directory.
3. Complete command in Luanti '/generate <file>.osm'.
4. For large areas it can take a few minutes to process.

Check out a [Detailed Guide](USAGEINSTRUCTIONS.MD).

# Limitations
1. If it does not work, try a smaller region.
2. The mod does not have any topographical information, which is a severe limitation. This means everything will be flat.
